This project was actually finished just in time for Halloween, but then life happened and I couldn't find the time to document it properly. So, here's how you crochet a sceleton hand.

Start by crocheting the fingers:
1. Make a magic ring with 4 single crochets <img src="/my-blog/crochet/images/skeleton_hand_beginning.png" />
2. Crochet 1 sc, then increase x2
3. Continue crocheting a small cilinder (3-4 rows)
4. When you reach the desired length of the phalanx, slip stich in the next loop and chain 6 (don't be confused by the picture, it is the same process for every phalanx, I just forgot to take a photo after the first one)

5. Slip stich in the first chain (this ring will be the start of the second phalanx)
6. Crochet 2 sc, then increase x2
7. After a few rows do some increases again (3 sc, then increase x2)
8. Crochet one row and then decrease back to 8 or even 6 loops
9. Make the chain and then the ring again, and crochet the next 2 phalanges, this time making even more increases, in the end the fingers look something like this <img src="/my-blog/crochet/images/skeleton_hand_fingers.png" />

The thumb is just another finger, but be careful, it has 3 cilinders in it instead of 4. However, as you can see in the picture, I decided to continue and crochet all the little bones that are placed at the base of the hand together with it.

In hindsight, if I crocheted them separately it would give me more control over the proporions and the hand would look even better, but I was in a rush when I was doing it.

Now, that you have all the elements, it's time to assemble.

And don't forget to find some pieces of wire and put them inside the hand, so you can shape it however you'd like.

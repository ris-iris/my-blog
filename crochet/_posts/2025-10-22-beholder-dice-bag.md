I few month ago I decided to make a hand-made gift satisfying three constraints: 
1. It should be practical;
2. It should be themed around DnD;
3. It should be doable in 3 afternoons (which automatically meant crochet, as I didn't have supplies for anything else at that time).

After a quick pinterest search, I found a cute amigurumi beholder, which, unfortunately wasn't very practical. And then I thought, why not make it a dice-bag? And this guy was made:

Since the size of the finished beholder and the precise number of crochets depends on the yarn that you want to use, I won't write a detailed row by row instruction and just leave the overal scheme here. I used some chenille yarn, which is very soft to touch, but may not be the best choise for beginers, as it is hard to see the crochet loops in it and if you want to unravel what you've done, the yarn just forms clumps and you can't reuse it.

So, here is the scheme:

To make the body of the beholder, I started to crochet a ball, which is a very common shape for the amigurumi parts. But instead of "closing" the ball, I stopped decreasing 3-4 rows before the top and continued to loop into every single crochet from the previous row. This way, you can actually place the dice inside the beholder. To close the bag, I made a thin cors from the white and black yarn I had. First I was thinking, that this cord can also have eyes on the ends, but then I realized that the blue yarn has to much friction over itself, and I stopped at the thin version.

The eyes (both small and the large one) are made starting with a circle of black yarn and then continuing with white yarn. The big eye got attached to the body with the blue yarn chan, which looped over both the eye and the body at every second step. This chain was at the same time creating the eyelid. The small eye "stems" were made with the simplest crochet cord you can make (this only worked because of how chunky my yarn was, othervise consider a more fancy cord). I made a total of 6 small eyes and attached them symmetrically to the body. The mouth was just embroidered directly on the body.

And there you have a menacing bag for your shiny math rocks. Make one for your favourite DM as well, they deserve it!

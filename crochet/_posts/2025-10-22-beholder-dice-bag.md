I few month ago I decided to make a hand-made gift satisfying two constraints: 
1. It should be practical;
2. It should be themed around DnD;
3. It should be doable in 3 afternoons (which automatically meant crochet, as I didn't have supplies for anything else).

After a quick pinterest search, I found a cute amigurumi beholder, which, unfortunately wasn't very practical. And then I thought, why not make it a dice-bag?
